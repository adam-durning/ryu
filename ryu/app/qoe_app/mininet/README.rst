Generate Network Metrics
========================

The generate_metrics.py_ script is used to generate and save link bandwidth, delay, and packet loss metrics. There is a CSV file created
for each path in the network (for example_). Currently this script can only generate metrics for the topology in three_paths_topo.py_.
The scipt will generate a set of metrics for each of the three paths for the desired number of simulations (edit the num_simulations parameter 
to adjust the number of simulations). 

.. _generate_metrics.py: https://github.com/adam-durning/ryu/blob/development_branch/ryu/app/qoe_app/mininet/generate_metrics.py

Topology Script
===============
The script three_paths_topo.py_ is a mininet script that generates the topology shown below. The metrics are read from the csv files generated by generate_metrics.py_;
these files are located in the topo_info_ directory.
