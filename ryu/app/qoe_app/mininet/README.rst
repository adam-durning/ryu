Mininet Scripts
===============

:Version: Mininet 2.3.0

The installation instructions for mininet can be found here_. 

**Note:** I installed mininet from the source github.

Generate Network Metrics
========================

The generate_metrics.py_ script is used to generate and save link bandwidth, delay, and packet loss metrics. There is a CSV file created
for each path in the network (for example_). Currently this script can only generate metrics for the topology in three_paths_topo.py_.
The scipt will generate a set of metrics for each of the three paths for the desired number of simulations (edit the num_simulations parameter 
to adjust the number of simulations).

Topology Script
===============
The script three_paths_topo.py_ is a mininet script that generates the topology shown below. This script also contains functions for sending UDP packets with the IPERF_ tool and for transmitting a video file with VLC_. The link metrics are passed to this script from qoe_experiments.py_.

How to run Simulations
======================

The qoe_experiments.py_ script is used to start the simulations. The metrics are read from the csv files generated by generate_metrics.py_;
these files are located in the topo_info_ directory. Set the upper limit in the range_ function to the number of experiments you wish to run.

  $ sudo python3 qoe_experiments.py
